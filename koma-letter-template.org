* To-address of the lovely Juliet                                        :to:
Juliet
House of Capulet
Verona

* Dear Juliet,
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when, and where, and how
We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

* PS                                                                     :ps:
